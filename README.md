This file is a README assosciated with the pands-problem-sheet submission for the 2022 Programming and Scripting Module and contains code, references, and comments for weekly tasks. 
Additional comments and references are contained within the .py files.

Files containing code and other material relating to the the weekly tasks can be found within this pands-problem-sheet repository.


Week 1: No submission

Week 2: Statements
Q: Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). Call the file bmi.py The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms. The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.

Code:
bmi.py

Week 3: Variables
Q: Write a program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.

Code:
secondString.py

Week 4: Controlling the flow
Q: Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.

At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

Have the program end if the current value is one.

program to calculate square root:

read in input as a float
define a function to estimate a square root. run a while loop to repeat the calculations.
call the function
print the answer
